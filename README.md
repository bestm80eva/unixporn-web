# Nixplorer website
A free non-profit GNU/Linux/*BSD image hosting and screenshot sharing service.

Feel free to suggest changes, contribute and improve the code.

https://www.nixplorer.org

# Latest changes
- I have cleaned up the code as much as i could at the moment, i've also moved away from MySQLi and now use PDO instead.

- Moved from the domain unixporn.org to nixplorer.org instead since the word "porn" blocked access via some company firewalls and public network filters.. as an example of reasons..

- Upgraded the VPS and enabled SSL.

- Removed lots of spam uploads and crawled images.

# Future plans
- Clean up the CSS (YES, i really need to get around to do that!)
- Create a member section, allow comments and votes on uploads.. etc.. But i still want to keep the site as simple as possible.
