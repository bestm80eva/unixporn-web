# Latest changes

- Added rss feed

- I have cleaned up the code as much as i could at the moment, i've also moved away from MySQLi and now use PDO instead.

- Added domain alias; nixplorer.org since the word "porn" blocked access via some company firewalls and public network filters.. as an example of reasons..

- Upgraded the VPS and enabled SSL.

- Removed lots of spam uploads and crawled images.

# Future plans
- Clean up the CSS (YES, i really need to get around to do that!)
- Find a solution to avoid using a cookie for the captcha during upload.
