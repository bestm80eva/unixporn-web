# Nixplorer website
Feel free to suggest changes, contribute and improve the code.

# Latest changes
- I have cleaned up the code as much as i could at the moment, i've also moved away from MySQLi and now use PDO instead.

- Moved from the domain unixporn.org to nixplorer.org instead since the word "porn" blocked access via some company firewalls and public network filters.. as an example of reasons..

- Upgraded the VPS and enabled SSL.

- Removed lots of spam uploads and crawled images.
